## Product: Levy Protocol

### Overview
Levy is a mercenary liquidity protocol on Solana. It creates an honest, transparent marketplace for liquidity by allowing projects to escrow SOL bounties that pay LPs proportional to their holdings over time.

The core thesis: mercenary capital is not a bug, it's a feature. Instead of fighting LP churn with governance tokens and vote-locking, Levy strips incentives down to a primitive — SOL in escrow, time-weighted payouts, non-custodial vaults.

### Program Details
- **Program ID**: `3hDJRcAJf5AHrRgkXhUUCcTYQVMkCubh9M6kTrsBZv55`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Framework**: Anchor 0.29
- **Protocol PDA**: `3AgK9is3ShJU82aHnsrzFyQXR85PDRZaduTQ6X8wkjVc`

### PDA Seeds
- Protocol: `[b"proto"]`
- Bounty: `[b"b", bounty_id (u64 LE)]`
- Vault: `[b"v", bounty_id (u64 LE)]`
- LpClaim: `[b"lc", bounty_pubkey, lp_pubkey]`

### Instructions
1. **initialize** — Set up the protocol with authority, treasury, and fee basis points
2. **create_bounty** — Deposit SOL into a PDA vault specifying pool mint, rate, and duration
3. **register_claim** — LP registers as a claimant on a bounty (one-time per bounty)
4. **collect** — LP collects accrued rewards: `payout = lp_balance * rate * (now - last_collected)`
5. **reclaim** — Creator reclaims remaining vault funds after bounty expires
6. **cancel** — Creator cancels bounty and recovers deposit (only if no claims yet)

### Account Types
- **Protocol** — Global state: authority, fee_bps, total_bounties, total_paid, treasury, bump
- **Bounty** — Per-bounty: id, creator, pool_mint, total_deposited, total_claimed, rate, start_time, end_time, status, bump
- **LpClaim** — Per LP per bounty: bounty, lp, last_collected, total_collected, bump

### Parameters
- Protocol fee: 500 bps (5%), configurable up to 1000 bps (10%)
- Minimum bounty deposit: 0.01 SOL (10,000,000 lamports)
- Bounty statuses: Active, Completed, Cancelled

### Frontend
- URL: https://fixr.nexus/levy
- Tabs: Browse (active bounties), Post Bounty (create), My Bounties (manage), About
- Features: Onboarding walkthrough modal, tooltips on all fields, real-time data refresh
- Legal: Terms, Privacy Policy, Disclaimer
